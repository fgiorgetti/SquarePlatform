## Plans and purposes

A 2D scrolling game created for learning about 2D game development,
using nothing but Java SE.

Hope to complete this game and then I am planning to re-create it 
using some game development library like LWJGL or LibGDX. But that is 
a future plan.

For now, the purpose is to have a complete 2D scrolling game with a
few levels, music, enemies, a menu and a few more stuff.
